# Funny Bunny - a very simple phaser game

In this project, I researched a popular JavaScript game engine, Phaser. It is useful for creating 2D games in the browser. 

## The instructions are simple: 
You move the bunny using your keyboard arrow keys. 

The goal is to catch as many carrots as possible, which add to your score. 

You may notice the bunny getting a bit fuller after so many carrots are eaten, which adds a little comic relief to the game.

# That's all, folks! 

Key takeaway:

- Game engines abstract a lot of lower-level coding. Without them, it would take forever to program the simplest game. That's why virutally all of today's games are made with them. If you're interested in coding a game, it would be smart to start learning about all the different game engines available. 
- I also spent a good amount of time looking at Babylon.js, a game engine capable of creating very powerful 3D experiences in the browser. Three.js is another good option.
